/// ReCrypt - Key Rotation for Authenticated Encryption
///
/// This is a research prototype and should never be used for important data
///
///
/// This library contains some prototype implementations of updatable encryption
/// schemes. See https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/527 for more details.
///
/// There are 2 main building blocks:
///   - Authenticated encryption schemes (AES and ChaCha from *ring*).
///   - Key-homomorphic PRF (using `curve25519_dalek`)
///
/// These can be composed to construct updatable encryption.
///
/// The "naive" schemes are `Naive` and `KemDem`, which do not meet our security
/// definitions and are included for reference.
///
/// The updatable schemes are `Kss` and `ReCrypt`. These can be found in the
/// [generic](generic/) module.
///
/// We also define the `UpEnc` and `UpEncCtxtIndep` traits, which match the definitions
/// given in our text.
